blueimp-md5: 
    usedFor: Hashing of email addresses for use with the Gravatar service.
    comments: 
        noNative: JavaScript does not feature a built-in MD5 implementation.
        noNode: The crypto module supports MD5. It does not seem possible to extract individual algorithms from crypto. The consequence is a minified bundle size of 431.78 KB compared with 4.86 KB for blueimp-md5 which is a significant difference.
        noCloser: According to [this issue](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5/issues/26), the original use case was to hash email addresses for Gravatar.

jsdom: 
    usedFor: Emulating a web browser so tests can be run with Node.js for speed.
    comments: 
        lowImpact: There does not seem to be any viable replacement for JSDOM. The fallback would be to run the tests in a browser. The cost is estimated to be low.
